## Recommendations

1. ✅ **Achievement System**: Phase 7 sub-issue created for gamification features
2. **Verify Phase Ordering**: Our phases are reordered but logically sound
3. **Consider Performance**: Phase 5 test execution must be < 500ms (noted in original)
4. **Security Review**: Phase 5 sandbox implementation needs security audit
5. **Sample Content**: Phase 6 should include 10-15 sample workshops
6. **Achievement Icons**: Phase 7 should include icon/badge designs
7. **Leaderboards**: Consider as future enhancement (not in original scope)
