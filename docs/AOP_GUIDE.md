# Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) Guide

## Overview

This guide explains the Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) approaches available in the Python Skill Builder application. AOP is a programming paradigm that complements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by separating **cross-cutting concerns** from business logic.

## What is AOP?

**Aspect-Oriented Programming** allows you to modularize cross-cutting concerns—functionality that affects multiple parts of an application but isn't part of the core business logic. In Python, AOP is primarily implemented through **decorators**.

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

Common cross-cutting concerns include:
- **Input/Output Validation** - Ensuring data integrity at function boundaries
- **Logging and Monitoring** - Tracking function calls and results
- **Performance Timing** - Measuring execution time
- **Caching/Memoization** - Storing results for performance optimization
- **Error Handling and Retry Logic** - Managing failures gracefully
- **Auditing and Security** - Tracking access and enforcing permissions

## Why Learn AOP?

1. **Real-World Skills** - AOP patterns are used in production systems for logging, monitoring, and security
2. **Code Quality** - Demonstrates separation of concerns and clean code principles
3. **Interview Prep** - Decorator questions are common in Python interviews
4. **Maintainability** - Keeps business logic clean by extracting cross-cutting concerns

## AOP Approaches by Module

### Module 1: Python Basics

#### basics_01: Validation Guard
**Concept:** Input validation aspect  
**Pattern:** Decorator that validates input before execution  
**Learning Goal:** Separate validation logic from business logic

```python
from functools import wraps

def validate_list(fn):
    @wraps(fn)
    def wrapper(nums):
        if not isinstance(nums, list) or not all(isinstance(x, int) for x in nums):
            raise TypeError('Invalid input: must be list of ints')
        return fn(nums)
    return wrapper

@validate_list
def even_squares(nums):
    return [n**2 for n in nums if n%2==0]
```

#### basics_02: Logging
**Concept:** Logging aspect  
**Pattern:** Decorator that logs function calls and results  
**Learning Goal:** Add observability without modifying core logic

### Module 2: Functions & Syntax

#### fx_01: Performance Timing
**Concept:** Performance timing aspect  
**Pattern:** Decorator that measures execution time  
**Learning Goal:** Monitor performance without cluttering code

#### fx_02: Type Checking
**Concept:** Type validation aspect  
**Pattern:** Decorator that validates argument types  
**Learning Goal:** Runtime type checking as a cross-cutting concern

### Module 3: OOP Fundamentals

#### oop_01: Audit Logging
**Concept:** Audit logging aspect for methods  
**Pattern:** Decorator that logs method calls on class instances  
**Learning Goal:** Track object interactions for debugging/auditing

#### oop_02: Memoization
**Concept:** Memoization aspect  
**Pattern:** Decorator that caches function results  
**Learning Goal:** Performance optimization through caching

### Module 4: Errors & Debugging

#### err_01: Retry with Backoff
**Concept:** Retry aspect with exponential backoff  
**Pattern:** Decorator that retries failed operations  
**Learning Goal:** Resilience through automatic retry logic

#### err_02: Centralized Error Handling
**Concept:** Centralized error handling aspect  
**Pattern:** Decorator that catches and transforms exceptions  
**Learning Goal:** Consistent error handling across functions

### Module 5: Comprehensions & Generators

#### cg_01: Input/Output Validation
**Concept:** Input/output validation aspect  
**Pattern:** Decorator that validates both inputs and outputs  
**Learning Goal:** Ensure data integrity at function boundaries

#### cg_02: Generator Monitoring
**Concept:** Generator monitoring aspect  
**Pattern:** Decorator that logs generator yields  
**Learning Goal:** Observe lazy evaluation in action

### Module 6: NumPy Intro

#### np_01: Shape Validation
**Concept:** Array shape validation aspect  
**Pattern:** Decorator that validates array shapes match  
**Learning Goal:** Prevent shape mismatch errors in NumPy operations

#### np_02: Performance Profiling
**Concept:** Performance profiling aspect  
**Pattern:** Decorator that profiles memory usage and execution time  
**Learning Goal:** Monitor performance of numerical operations

### Module 7: Flask Intro

#### fl_01: Request Logging
**Concept:** Request logging aspect  
**Pattern:** Decorator that logs all requests (simulating Flask middleware)  
**Learning Goal:** Track all function calls for debugging

#### fl_02: Authentication Guard
**Concept:** Authentication guard aspect  
**Pattern:** Decorator that adds authentication checks  
**Learning Goal:** Secure endpoints with reusable authentication logic

## Key Concepts

### The Decorator Pattern

All AOP approaches use Python's decorator pattern:

```python
from functools import wraps

def my_decorator(fn):
    @wraps(fn)  # Preserves function metadata
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Before: Add cross-cutting concern logic here
        result = fn(*args, **kwargs)
        # After: Add more cross-cutting concern logic here
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def my_function():
    # Core business logic here
    pass
```

### Why Use `@wraps`?

The `@wraps(fn)` decorator from `functools` preserves the original function's metadata (name, docstring, etc.), which is important for debugging and introspection.

### Parameterized Decorators

Some decorators accept parameters:

```python
def retry(max_attempts=3, delay=0.1):
    def decorator(fn):
        @wraps(fn)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # Use max_attempts and delay here
            pass
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@retry(max_attempts=5, delay=0.2)
def my_function():
    pass
```

## Benefits of AOP

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Business logic stays clean and focused
2. **Reusability** - Decorators can be applied to multiple functions
3. **Maintainability** - Changes to cross-cutting concerns are centralized
4. **Testability** - Business logic and aspects can be tested independently
5. **Readability** - Intent is clear from decorator names

## Best Practices

1. **Use `@wraps`** - Always use `functools.wraps` to preserve function metadata
2. **Keep Decorators Focused** - Each decorator should handle one concern
3. **Document Behavior** - Clearly document what each decorator does
4. **Handle Edge Cases** - Consider what happens with different argument types
5. **Test Thoroughly** - Test both the decorator and the decorated function

## Completion Requirements

- Workshop completion requires **any one approach** to score >= 80%
- AOP approaches are **optional** - you can complete workshops with traditional approaches
- Each AOP approach demonstrates **real-world patterns** used in production systems
