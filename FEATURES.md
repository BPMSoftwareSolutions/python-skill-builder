## Alternative Implementations Feature

### Overview
Workshops can now offer **multiple approaches** to solving the same problem, allowing learners to:
- Compare different implementation strategies (e.g., list comprehension vs. for-loop)
- Learn multiple patterns for the same task
- Choose their preferred learning style
- Complete a workshop by mastering ANY one approach

### Implementation Details

**JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "id": "basics_01",
  "title": "Even Squares",
  "prompt": "...",
  "approaches": [
    {
      "id": "comprehension",
      "title": "List Comprehension",
      "description": "Use Python's concise list comprehension syntax",
      "starterCode": "...",
      "hints": ["..."],
      "tests": "..."
    },
    {
      "id": "loop",
      "title": "For Loop",
      "description": "Use traditional for-loop with append",
      "starterCode": "...",
      "hints": ["..."],
      "tests": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Completion Logic:**
- Workshop is **100% complete** when ANY approach scores >= 80%
- Module is **100% complete** when ALL workshops have at least one completed approach
- Users can attempt multiple approaches for deeper learning
- Each approach has its own hints, starter code, and validation tests

**Progress Tracking:**
```javascript
{
  "python_basics": {
    "scores": { "basics_01": 100 },  // Highest score across all approaches
    "approachScores": {
      "basics_01": {
        "comprehension": 100,
        "loop": 85
      }
    },
    "code": {
      "basics_01": {
        "comprehension": "def even_squares(nums):\n    return [n**2 for n in nums if n % 2 == 0]",
        "loop": "def even_squares(nums):\n    result = []\n    for n in nums:\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            result.append(n**2)\n    return result"
      }
    },
    "approaches": { "basics_01": "comprehension" }  // Last selected approach
  }
}
```

- **basics_02** - `aop_logging`: Execution logging decorator

#### Module 2: Functions & Syntax
- **fx_01** - `aop_timing`: Performance timing decorator
- **fx_02** - `aop_type_checking`: Runtime type validation decorator

#### Module 3: OOP Fundamentals
- **oop_01** - `aop_audit`: Method call auditing decorator
- **oop_02** - `aop_caching`: Memoization decorator

#### Module 4: Errors & Debugging
- **err_01** - `aop_retry`: Retry with exponential backoff decorator

#### Module 5: Comprehensions & Generators
- **cg_01** - `aop_validation_decorator`: Input/output validation decorator
- **cg_02** - `aop_generator_logging`: Generator monitoring decorator

#### Module 6: NumPy Intro

- **fl_02** - `aop_authentication`: Authentication guard decorator

### Educational Value
- Teaches advanced Python decorator patterns
- Demonstrates separation of concerns
- Real-world skills used in production systems
- Common interview topic
- Shows how to write cleaner, more maintainable code

### Implementation Details
- All decorators use `functools.wraps` to preserve function metadata
- Each approach includes unique ID, title, description, starter code, 3 hints, and test harness
- Tests validate both functionality and decorator usage
- Comprehensive documentation in `docs/AOP_GUIDE.md`

---

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (as of commit 4641dcd + Issue #27 AOP implementation)

**Next Steps:**
- Push changes and create PR for Issue #27
- Manual QA testing of AOP approaches
- Update test suite to include AOP-specific tests
- Consider starting Issue #25 (Reflexive AI Education)
